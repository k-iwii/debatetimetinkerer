# DebateTime Tinkerer

This flutter app is designed to work alongside the electronic debate speech timer that I built using Arduino hardware.
 It allows the user to customize their timer to their liking.

*The user can...*
* Add and customize up to 2 debate formats
* Select a timer or stopwatch format
* Customize the colour of the LED on the timer
